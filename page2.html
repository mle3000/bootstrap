  <h1>Foods You Can Share:</h1><p class="lead">NOTE: All foods should be given in moderation. An excess of any food may cause problems for your dog </p></div>
  <div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-8 pt-5 mt-2"><h2>Watermelon</h2><p class="lead">The benefits of watermelon for dogs? The fruit itself is a health-food powerhouse, low in calories and packed with nutrients—vitamins A, B6, and C, and potassium. Plus, the fruit has only about 50 calories a cup and 92 percent water, so it’s great for hydration on a hot day. It also has no fat or cholesterol, so it’s pretty much guilt-free.</p><p>CAUTION: Seeds can cause problems for dogs, make sure you remove them before feeding watermelon to your pup!</p><</div>    <div class="col-sm-4"><span class="float-right p-5">

      <img src= "spinach.jpg" class="rounded" width="65%"></span></div>
   <div class="col-sm-8 pt-5 mt-2"><h2>Spinach</h2><p class="lead">Spinach contains large amounts of vitamins A, B, C, and K. It also contains iron, antioxidants, beta-carotene, and roughage, which stimulate the digestive tract. Presumably, you feed your dog a healthy, nutritious dog food that contains everything he needs, but small amounts of spinach can provide benefits.</p><p>CAUTION: Spinach is very high in oxalic acid, which blocks the body’s ability to absorb calcium and can lead to kidney damage. Many sources agree that a dog would have to eat very large quantities of spinach to cause damage. Dogs that have healthy kidneys can easily process small amounts of soluble oxalates</p></div>

  <h1>Foods Your Dog Should Never Eat:</h1></div>
  <div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-8 pt-5 mt-2"><h2>Grapes/Raisins</h2><p class="lead">Grapes and raisins (dried grapes) have proved to be very toxic for dogs no matter the dog’s breed, sex, or age. In fact, grapes are so toxic that they can lead to acute sudden kidney failure. Always be mindful of this dangerous fruit for dogs.</p><p>Every dog has a different tolerance for bad foods. Some dogs can eat tons of grapes and never get sick and some can die from a single encounter. Why risk it?</p></div>    <div class="col-sm-4"><span class="float-right p-5">

    <div class="col-sm-8 pt-5 mt-2"><h2>Chocolate</h2><p class="lead">While rarely fatal, chocolate ingestion can result in significant illness. Chocolate is toxic because it contains a chemical called theobromine, as well as caffeine. Theobromine is the main toxin in chocolate and is very similar to caffeine. Both chemicals are used medicinally as a diuretic, heart stimulant, blood vessel dilator, and a smooth muscle relaxant. Dogs cannot metabolize theobromine and caffeine as well as people can. That is why dogs are more sensitive to the chemicals’ effects. </p></div>   </div></div>
